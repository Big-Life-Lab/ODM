# Parts

Parts are the smallest way of describing anything in the ODM. Think of the example of parts of a car. If you own a car, your garage can access a parts list that contains every part of your car -- right down to every nut and bolt. The same is true for the ODM.

The ODM has a part ID (partID) and part description (partDescription) for every measure, method and attribute. There are also partIDs for measure categories, units, aggreations, and other parts. Below is the part list.
