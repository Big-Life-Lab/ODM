## Description

PHES-ODM began as an open data model for wastwater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. PHES-ODM Version 2 expands the original ODM to include surface and air testing, in addition to water. Version 2 also include robust support for reporting any biologic, toxin, or other health risks.

The ODM strives to improve wastewater surveillance through interoperable data. The ODM follows an open science approach, including including [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). Uses an Open software approach, including operates with the guidance of an international [steering committee](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/covid-19-wastewater/wiki). People and institutions can contribute to the development of the ODM and the ODM seeks to support a wide range of users.

## This repository includes

- **[Dictionary reference files](dictionary-tables)** for all ODM versions.
- **[Scripts](src)** to set up an SQL relational database for the ODM schema.
- **[Roadmap and work-in-progress](roadmap.md)**.
- **[How to contribute](#colloborate)**.
- **[Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.
- **[Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)**.
- **[Steering committee minutes](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/PHES-ODM/wiki)**.

## Additional resources

- **[ODM documentation website](https://docs.phes-odm.org)**: the main source of information for the ODM.
The documentation website includes:

  - An introduction the ODM.
  - A quick start guide.
  - How-to guides.
  - Background and explantaory guide to how the ODM works.
  - The reference files in searchable, human readible format.
  - Links to other resources.

- **[Report templates](https://osf.io/ab9se/)**: Excel templates to report or store ODM data in the 'long' format. 

- **[Dictionary as an Excel file](https://osf.io/ab9se/)**: The Excel version of the dictionary. There are worksheets for each dictionary look-up table. 

- **[ODM validation toolkit](https://validate-docs.phes-odm.org)**: Ensure your ODM data is complete and interoperable. You can check whether your data meets the ODM dictionary format.

## Data and metadata dictionary

The ODM is comprised of 15 report tables and six look-up tables, linked to each other based on logic relationships. The following figure provides an overview of the different data sources that are currently captured.

## Application

PHES ODM is used or planned for use in 23 countries. Programs that use or are implementing the ODM include the European Union's Digital European Exchange Platform (DEEP), Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML), Ontario's Wastewater Initiative by the Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP), uOttawa, le Centre québécois de recherche sur la gestion de l'eau, Université Laval.

ODM forms part other platforms and tools including:
- [CETO Epidemiologic platform](https://ceto.ca).
- [Ottawa Automatic Data Pipelines](https://phes-odm.org).
